# Michael Vinh Xuan Thanh

Hi there, I'm Michael. ðŸ‘‹
My coworkers and audience call me Vinny.

I'm a Lead Solutions Engineer by day, software engineer and musician by night.

I've largely paused working on most of my side projects to focus on other things. I still [write occasionally](http://blog.mvxt.me/) though about coding, productivity, and career, among other topics.

Stuff I've done in the past:
- [VinnyTheN00b](https://www.twitch.tv/vinnythen00b) - Streaming games, music production, and coding.
- [The Static Void Academy](https://www.staticvoidacademy.com/) - Online website for people to learn coding.
- [App of the Month](https://monthlyapp.substack.com/) - Monthly newsletter where I recommend and review productivity/business apps.

For more information about me, such as social media and professional work history, visit my main website linked on the left.

**Thanks for stopping by!**
