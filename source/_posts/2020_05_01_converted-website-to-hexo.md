After over a year of procrastinating the project, I decided against creating my own CMS and/or static site generator. I have multiple other projects in-progress and decided they were higher priority.

Instead, I've slapped together my own Hexo theme from my original website's CSS, and I will be writing a multi-part series soon on how to design a Hexo theme from scratch for those who want to start their own blog with Hexo.

Keep in mind that there are a lot of [pre-made themes](https://hexo.io/themes/), but I wanted something a little more minimalistic and clean.
