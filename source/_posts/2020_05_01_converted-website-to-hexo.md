After many months of procrastinating the project, I decided against attempting to create my own CMS and/or static site generator. I have multiple other projects in-progress and decided they were higher priority.

Instead, I've slapped together my own Hexo theme from my original website's CSS, and I will be writing a multi-part series soon on how to design a Hexo theme if you decide to start your own blog with Hexo.

In the meantime, thanks again for visiting my website. Please reach out via LinkedIn or GitHub if you'd like to chat.
