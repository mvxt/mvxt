Finally finished my personal website restructure. It uses [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), making it much easier to post new updates. All of my current projects are also added to the [Projects page](/projects), and all of the information is up-to-date.

This website will primarily be for personal updates about projects and musings that don't belong on other platforms.

- Software and coding-related material will all be under [The Static Void Academy blog](https://www.staticvoid.dev/).
- Or, if you're interested in learning software, I teach. Visit the SVA's [main course page](https://www.staticvoidacademy.com/).
- Politics, productivity, success, and other life-related writings are posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michael.thanh).
- I have a monthly newsletter where I recommend and review applications for success and productivity. [Sign up here](https://bitly.com/monthlyappsub).

Otherwise, thank you for stopping by! As always, if you need to reach out to me, check my [About page](/about) for contact information, or visit one of my social links in the footer.
